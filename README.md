a thin wrapper for openpgp exposing core functionality
built on ephemeral immutable keys
over an API that does not leak cryptographic material.

together with [worker-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-proxy),
this service can easily be run in a WebWorker,
confining the cryptographic material in a dedicated thread.

## cryptographic material is encapsulated
client code manages proxies of the openpgp keys,
each key proxy includes a handle (reference) to the corresponding openpgp key.

the handle is a unique cryptographically secure random string,
completely independent from the referenced cryptographic material,
which remains well contained within the `opgp-service` instance
and does not leak into client code.

## keys are ephemeral
the service invalidates proxy handles if not used during a defined time lapse.
after a key proxy is invalidated,
client code can still fetch a new instance from the service, whenever required.

## keys are immutable
the service also invalidates a proxy handle when an openpgp operation
mutates a key's state.

in the current API, only the `lock` method which encrypts a private key
hence clearly mutates the key.
after a key is locked by the service,
all proxies to the unlocked state become invalid.

key proxies always represent a key in an immutable state.
this hinders coupling in client code through the service API.

# <a name="example"></a> EXAMPLE
```javascript
import getService from 'opgp-service'
import * as bluebird from 'bluebird'

const service = getService()

const armor =
  ['-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----',
    'Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (GNU/Linux)',
    /* ... left out for brevity ... */
    '-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----'].join('\n')
const passphrase = 'passphrase to decrypt private key'

// import the key and unlock it
const key = service.getKeysFromArmor(armor).then(keys => keys[0])
const unlocked = key.then(key => service.unlock(key.handle, secret))

// encrypt with public key
const cipher = key.then(key => service.encode(key.handle, 'rob says wow!'))
.tap(log)

// decrypt with decrypted private key
const plain = Promise.join(unlocked, cipher,
  (unlocked, cipher) => service.decode(unlocked.handle, cipher))
.tap(log)
```
