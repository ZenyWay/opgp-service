a fully async API for [openpgp](https://openpgpjs.org/)
that builds on ephemeral immutable keys and
that does not leak cryptographic material.

together with [worker-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-proxy),
this service can easily be run in a WebWorker,
confining the cryptographic material into a dedicated thread.

the current version exposes a subset of [openpgp](https://openpgpjs.org/)'s
functionality.

## cryptographic material is encapsulated
client code operates on mere proxies of the openpgp keys, not the latter.

each key proxy includes a handle (reference) to the corresponding openpgp key.
the handle is a unique cryptographically secure random string,
completely independent from the referenced cryptographic material,
which remains well contained within the `opgp-service` instance
and does not leak into client code.

## keys are ephemeral
the service invalidates proxy handles if not used during a defined time lapse.
after a key proxy is invalidated,
client code can still fetch a new instance from the service, whenever required.

## keys are immutable
the service also invalidates a proxy handle when an openpgp operation
mutates a key's state.

in the current API, only the `lock` method, which encrypts a private key,
mutates the key.
when a key is locked, all proxies to the unlocked state become stale.

key proxies always represent a key in an immutable state.
this hinders coupling in client code through the service API.

## fully async
async all the way streamlines error-control flow:
* all API methods return a `Promise`.
* any exception thrown by `openpgp` is converted into a rejected `Promise`.

# <a name="example"></a> EXAMPLE
```javascript
import getService from 'opgp-service'
import * as Promise from 'bluebird'
import fs = require('fs')
const log = console.log.bind(console)

const service = getService() // use defaults

const armor = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/<john.doe@example.com>.private.key`, 'utf8')
const passphrase = 'passphrase to decrypt private key'
const secret = 'rob says wow!'

log('import key...')
const key = service.getKeysFromArmor(armor)
.tap(() => log('key successfully imported!\nnow unlock key...'))

const unlocked = key.then(key => service.unlock(key, passphrase))
.tap(() => log('key successfully unlocked!\nnow encrypt then decrypt `${secret}`...'))

// encrypt with public key, sign with private
const cipher = unlocked
.then(key => service.encrypt({ cipher: key, auth: key }, secret))
.tap(log) // '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- ... -----END PGP MESSAGE-----'

// decrypt with private key, verify signature with public
const plain = Promise.join(unlocked, cipher,
(key, cipher) => service.decrypt({ cipher: key, auth: key }, cipher))
.tap(log) // 'rob says wow!'
```

note that [openpgp](https://npmjs.com/package/openpgp) is defined as a
[peer dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies)
and should be added as a dependency in client modules.
