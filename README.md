a fully async API for [openpgp](https://openpgpjs.org/)
that builds on ephemeral immutable keys and
that does not leak cryptographic material.

together with [worker-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-proxy),
this service can [easily be run in a WebWorker](https://gist.github.com/smcatala/bee0f411b08ec45933cb69264812a62e),
confining the cryptographic material into a dedicated thread.

## cryptographic material is encapsulated
client code operates on mere proxies of the openpgp keys, not the latter.

each key proxy includes a handle (reference) to the corresponding openpgp key.
the handle is a unique cryptographically secure random string,
completely independent from the referenced cryptographic material,
which remains well contained within the `opgp-service` instance
and does not leak into client code.

## keys are ephemeral
the service invalidates proxy handles if not used during a defined time lapse.
after a key proxy is invalidated,
client code can still fetch a new instance from the service, whenever required.

## keys are immutable
the service also invalidates a proxy handle when an openpgp operation
mutates a key's state.

in the current API, only the `lock` method, which encrypts a private key,
mutates the key.
when a key is locked, all proxies to the unlocked state become stale.

key proxies always represent a key in an immutable state.
this hinders coupling in client code through the service API.

## fully async
async all the way streamlines error-control flow:
* all API methods return a `Promise`.
* any exception thrown by `openpgp` is converted into a rejected `Promise`.

# <a name="api"></a> API 1.2 stable
the current version exposes the following service methods:
* configure
* generateKey, getKeysFromArmor, getArmorFromKey
* unlock, lock
* encrypt, decrypt
* sign, verify

for a detailed specification of the API
* run the [unit tests](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/opgp-service/v1.3.0/spec/web/index.html)
in your browser,
* or check the [public interface declaration](https://github.com/ZenyWay/opgp-service/blob/master/src/index.ts#L22-L234)
in the source code.

# <a name="example"></a> EXAMPLE
a live version of this example can be viewed [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/opgp-service/v1.3.0/spec/example/index.html)
in the browser console,
or by cloning this repository and running the following commands from a terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run example
```
the files of this example are available [here](./spec/example).

```javascript
import getService from 'opgp-service'
import * as Promise from 'bluebird'
import fs = require('fs')
const log = console.log.bind(console)

const service = getService() // use defaults

const armor = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/<john.doe@example.com>.private.key`, 'utf8')
const passphrase = 'passphrase to decrypt private key'
const secret = 'rob says wow!'

log('import key...')
const key = service.getKeysFromArmor(armor)
.tap(() => log('key successfully imported!\nnow unlock key...'))

const unlocked = key.then(key => service.unlock(key, passphrase))
.tap(() => log('key successfully unlocked!\nnow encrypt then decrypt `${secret}`...'))

// encrypt with public key, sign with private
const cipher = unlocked
.then(key => service.encrypt({ cipher: key, auth: key }, secret))
.tap(log) // '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- ... -----END PGP MESSAGE-----'

// decrypt with private key, verify signature with public
const plain = Promise.join(unlocked, cipher)
.then(([key, cipher]) => service.decrypt({ cipher: key, auth: key }, cipher))
.tap(log) // 'rob says wow!'
.catch(log)
```
