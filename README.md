a fully async API for [openpgp](https://openpgpjs.org/)
that builds on ephemeral immutable keys and
that does not leak cryptographic material.

together with [worker-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-proxy),
this service can [easily be run in a WebWorker](https://gist.github.com/smcatala/bee0f411b08ec45933cb69264812a62e),
confining the cryptographic material into a dedicated thread.

## cryptographic material is encapsulated
client code operates on mere proxies of the openpgp keys, not the latter.

each key proxy includes a handle (reference) to the corresponding openpgp key.
the handle is a unique cryptographically secure random string,
completely independent from the referenced cryptographic material,
which remains well contained within the `opgp-service` instance
and does not leak into client code.

## keys are ephemeral
the service invalidates proxy handles if not used during a defined time lapse.
after a key proxy is invalidated,
client code can still fetch a new instance from the service, whenever required.

## keys are immutable
the service also invalidates a proxy handle when an openpgp operation
mutates a key's state.

in the current API, only the `lock` method, which encrypts a private key,
mutates the key.
when a key is locked, all proxies to the unlocked state become stale.

key proxies always represent a key in an immutable state.
this hinders coupling in client code through the service API.

## fully async: reads like sync
async all the way makes it easy to write code that [reads like synchronous code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-call),
and streamlines error-control flow.
* all API methods return a `Promise`.
* any exception thrown by `openpgp` is converted into a rejected `Promise`.

# <a name="example"></a> EXAMPLE
```javascript
import getService from 'opgp-service'
import getResolve from 'resolve-call'
const resolve = getResolve()
import fs = require('fs')
import debug = require('debug')
const log = resolve(debug('example:'))

const toKeyRing = resolve((key: OpgpProxyKey) => ({ cipher: key, auth: key }))

const service = getService() // use defaults

const armor = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/<john.doe@example.com>.private.key`, 'utf8')
const passphrase = 'passphrase to decrypt private key'
const secret = 'rob says wow!'

log('import key...')
const key = service.getKeysFromArmor(armor)
const keys = toKeyRing(service.unlock(key, passphrase))

// encrypt with public key, sign with private
const cipher = service.encrypt(keys, secret)
log(cipher) // '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- ... -----END PGP MESSAGE-----'

// decrypt with private key, verify signature with public
const plain = service.decrypt(keys, cipher)
log(plain) // 'rob says wow!'
```
note that although the above code reads like synchronous code,
it is in fact fully async.
the files of this example are available [here](./spec/example).

a live version of this example can be viewed [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/opgp-service/v2.1.0/spec/example/index.html)
in the browser console,
or by cloning this repository and running the following commands from a terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run example
```

# <a name="api"></a> API 2.0 stable
the current version exposes the following service methods:
* configure
* generateKey, getKeysFromArmor, getArmorFromKey
* unlock, lock
* encrypt, decrypt
* sign, verify

all methods accept arguments that may be either immediately available,
or a Promise that eventually resolves, and return a Promise,
as demonstrated in the above example.

for a detailed specification of the API
* run the [unit tests](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/opgp-service/v2.1.0/spec/web/index.html)
in your browser,
* or check the [public interface declaration](./src/index.ts#L24-L414)
in the source code.
